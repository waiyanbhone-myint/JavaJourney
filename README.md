# Java Journey ☕

This repository is my personal space to practice and document Java concepts as I learn them.  
It includes examples, exercises, and notes covering basics, OOP, collections, generics, and other core topics.  

The goal is to build a solid foundation in Java for real-world development and DevOps work.
